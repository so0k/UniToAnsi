# UniToAnsi
Ugly work around to convert UTF-8 file to ASCII while keeping fixed width

This quickfix will read a text file (assuming UTF8) and encode it as us-ascii, replacing any invalid characters with question marks "?"

##Usage

Drag & drop the UTF-8 file onto the UniToAnsi.exe, the ascii equivalent will be generated in the same directory as the UTF-8 file.
